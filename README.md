Project Overview:https://public.tableau.com/app/profile/sydney.ani/viz/shared/GJWHNXD2H
This project presents an in-depth data analysis and visualization of Walmart store sales between 2010 and 2012, built using Tableau. The primary objective was to uncover key patterns, trends, and factors influencing sales performance, with a special focus on the impact of holidays, seasonal fluctuations, and store-level performance.

The dataset includes weekly sales records from 45 Walmart stores along with economic and environmental factors such as CPI, fuel price, temperature, and unemployment rate. Key calculated fields were created in Tableau to segment data by holiday type, semester, quarter, and month for deeper insights.

Key Analysis Areas:
Sales by Store: Store 20 recorded the highest sales ($301.4M), followed by Stores 4 and 14.

Sales Variability: Store 14 showed the largest weekly sales fluctuations, while Store 37 was the most stable.

Holiday Impact: Thanksgiving averaged ~$1.47M in weekly sales, outperforming all other holidays and non-holiday weeks. Christmas week sales were lower than non-holiday weeks, possibly due to earlier shopping trends.

Seasonal Patterns: Sales peaked in November and December; Semester 1 consistently outperformed Semester 2.

Forecasting: A regression model for Store 1 (using CPI, unemployment, fuel prices) showed a mild decline in sales but limited predictive power, suggesting other factors like promotions and events matter more.

Recommendations:
Replicate Store 20â€™s strategies across other stores.

Focus promotions around Thanksgiving to maximize revenue.

Address high sales volatility in certain locations.

Improve forecasts by adding weather, competitor, and marketing data.
